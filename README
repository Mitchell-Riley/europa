Europa Programming Language

Overview

	Europa is an implementation of the Io programming language. It is a
	pure object-oriented language based off of prototypes instead of
	classes. This is just a stub.

Why?

	Because Steve Dekorte's VM (herein, the "mainline") needs a lot of
	work. It's also grown into a large and complex system in recent years,
	with over 75 addons to contend with, tens of thousands of lines of
	code... To make large changes requires a lot of attention to detail.

	So rather than contend with that, why not write my own?

	In addition to the above, I wanted to learn the Go language, and what
	better way to learn a programming language than by implementing one
	you already know very well?

Requirements

	To build Europa, we use Go. It's being developed with Google Go 6g,
	though it very likely works with other Go compilers.

License

	Unless otherwise noted, Europa is released under the terms and
	conditions of the MIT license which may be found in the licenses/MIT.txt
	file.

	Contributions to Europa's core will need to be placed in kind. The
	rationale for this is that this VM is meant for education purposes, but
	I don't want to rule out other uses. It is my desire that the whole
	system remain under one license that is very liberalâ€”One that imposes
	as few restrictions as possible.

	For my conditions for contribution, please read the README.Contrib file.
