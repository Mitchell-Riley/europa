Europa Programming Language

Overview

	Europa is an implementation of the Io programming language. It is a
	pure object-oriented language based off of prototypes instead of
	classes. This is just a stub.

Why?

	Because Steve Dekorte's VM (herein, the "mainline") needs a lot of
	work. It's also grown into a large and complex system in recent years,
	with over 75 addons to contend with, tens of thousands of lines of
	code... To make large changes requires a lot of attention to detail.

	So rather than contend with the above for exploritory work, a new
	VM can be written specifically for this purpose.

	Europa's aim will be to produce a high performance IoVM, while
	retaining as much of the core functionality of Io as humanly possible.
	Some things, like transformations of { } and [ ] may be discarded.

Requirements

	To build Europa, we use Go. It's being developed with Google Go 6g,
	though it very likely works with other Go compilers.

License

	Unless otherwise noted, Europa is released under the terms and
	conditions of the MIT license which may be found in the licenses/MIT.txt
	file.

	Contributions to Europa's core will need to be placed in kind.
